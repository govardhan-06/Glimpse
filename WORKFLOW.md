Building a recommendation system for a Tinder-like app in the fashion domain, where users can swipe left (dislike) or right (like) on items (e.g., dresses), requires a robust backend architecture. Below is the step-by-step workflow and components needed to set up the backend for this kind of app using PyTorch (for model training), Flask/FastAPI (for the backend API), and a database (for storing user/item data and interactions).

1. Workflow Overview

User Actions:

Users interact with the app by swiping left (dislike) or right (like) on fashion items (dresses).

The system will recommend new fashion items based on previous user preferences.


Backend Responsibilities:

Storing user interactions (likes/dislikes).

Training or fine-tuning the recommendation model (periodically or online learning).

Fetching recommendations dynamically based on user history.

Delivering item details to the frontend.


Backend Tech Stack:

PyTorch for model training and recommendations.

Flask/FastAPI for the API layer.

Redis (optional) for caching recommendations.

PostgreSQL/MySQL for user-item interaction storage.

S3/Cloudinary for image storage of fashion items.

Nginx (optional) for serving static files.

2. Detailed Backend Workflow

Step 1: User Registration/Login & Authentication

JWT Token Authentication:

Users will sign up and log in, and upon successful login, they will receive a JWT token to authenticate their session.

Each user will have a unique user_id, which is used to store preferences, interactions, and other data.


API:

POST /register: Creates a new user.

POST /login: Authenticates the user and returns a JWT token.


from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException, Depends
from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordBearer

app = FastAPI()
oauth2_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer(tokenUrl="login")

@app.post("/register")
async def register(user_data: dict):
    # Add user to the database
    pass

@app.post("/login")
async def login(user_data: dict):
    # Validate credentials and return JWT
    pass


Step 2: Storing User-Item Interactions

Every time a user swipes left or right, we need to store that interaction in a database.

Right swipe: Marks a positive interaction (like).

Left swipe: Marks a negative interaction (dislike).


Use a table like user_item_interactions to store these preferences.

Table Schema:

CREATE TABLE user_item_interactions (
    interaction_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT,
    item_id INT,
    interaction_type BOOLEAN,  -- True for like, False for dislike
    timestamp TIMESTAMP
);

API:

POST /interaction: Logs the interaction.


@app.post("/interaction")
async def log_interaction(user_id: int, item_id: int, interaction_type: bool):
    # Insert interaction into database
    pass


Step 3: Model Training & Embedding Generation

Model Type: A collaborative filtering model (e.g., matrix factorization) or hybrid recommendation model like LightFM or DLRM.

Use PyTorch to train the model on historical interactions to generate embeddings for users and items.

Training Steps:

Prepare your interaction data (user-item pairs with like/dislike labels).

Periodically train the model on this interaction data.

Generate user embeddings and item embeddings.


Example (Using PyTorch):

import torch
from torch import nn

class RecommendationModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, n_users, n_items, n_factors):
        super().__init__()
        self.user_factors = nn.Embedding(n_users, n_factors)
        self.item_factors = nn.Embedding(n_items, n_factors)

    def forward(self, user, item):
        return (self.user_factors(user) * self.item_factors(item)).sum(1)

model = RecommendationModel(n_users=1000, n_items=5000, n_factors=20)

After training, the model will produce embeddings for each user and item, which will be used to compute similarity scores and recommendations.


Step 4: Storing Recommendations (Caching with Redis)

After generating recommendations, store them in Redis for quick retrieval (optional).

Redis will act as a cache for recently computed recommendations.


Example:

import redis
redis_client = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)

def cache_recommendations(user_id, recommendations):
    redis_client.set(f'recs:{user_id}', recommendations, ex=3600)  # 1-hour expiration


Step 5: Fetching Recommendations

When a user opens the app, you will query for recommendations based on their past preferences and embeddings.

Recommendation API:

The backend will compute the similarity between the current userâ€™s embedding and all item embeddings.

You can also factor in item attributes like category, color, or price to personalize results further.


API:

GET /recommendations: Fetches recommendations based on user embedding.


@app.get("/recommendations")
async def get_recommendations(user_id: int):
    # Retrieve the user embedding
    user_embedding = model.user_factors(torch.tensor([user_id]))

    # Fetch item embeddings from model
    item_embeddings = model.item_factors.weight

    # Compute similarity scores
    scores = torch.matmul(user_embedding, item_embeddings.T)
    top_items = torch.argsort(scores, descending=True)[:10]  # Top 10 items

    return top_items.tolist()


Step 6: Image Serving for Fashion Items

The fashion items (dresses) have associated images that need to be served to the frontend.

Use AWS S3, Cloudinary, or a similar service for image hosting and retrieval.

API:

GET /item/{item_id}: Fetch the details (including the image URL) for a specific item.


Example:

@app.get("/item/{item_id}")
async def get_item(item_id: int):
    # Retrieve item details from the database
    item_data = get_item_from_db(item_id)
    return item_data


Step 7: Periodic Model Updates

Based on new user interactions, periodically retrain the recommendation model to keep the recommendations up to date.

You can set up a scheduler (e.g., Celery, Airflow) to retrain the model daily or weekly, depending on data volume and frequency of updates.

3. Full Workflow

1. User Authentication:

Register/Login with JWT-based authentication.



2. Logging Interactions:

Store every swipe interaction (like/dislike) into a relational database.



3. Training the Recommendation Model:

Use PyTorch to train on user-item interactions and generate embeddings.

Periodically retrain the model to adapt to user behavior changes.



4. Generating Recommendations:

Fetch the top recommended items based on user embeddings and similarity scores.

Cache recommendations in Redis for faster retrieval (optional).



5. Serving Item Details & Images:

Serve the fashion item details (name, description, price, and image) through a database and an image hosting service.



6. Periodic Model Retraining:

Use a scheduler to update the recommendation model periodically.
