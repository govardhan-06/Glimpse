### **Final Workflow for the Backend**

1. **User Authentication**:
   - **Tech Stack**: FastAPI/Flask, JWT (JSON Web Tokens), Redis (optional for session management)
   - **Workflow**: Users register and log in. Authentication tokens are generated and optionally stored in Redis for quick session validation.

2. **Swiping Logic**:
   - **Tech Stack**: FastAPI/Flask, PostgreSQL/MySQL
   - **Workflow**:
     - **Right Swipe**: Adds the item to the user's favorites.
     - **Left Swipe**: Logs the item as disliked.
     - Interactions are logged in the database to build user profiles for recommendations.

3. **Recommendation System**:
   - **Tech Stack**: PyTorch, FastAPI/Flask, Redis
   - **Workflow**:
     - **Generate Recommendations**: Based on user interactions and preferences using PyTorch models.
     - **Cache Recommendations**: Store the generated recommendations in Redis with TTL to speed up subsequent requests.

4. **Price Comparison and Cart System**:
   - **Tech Stack**: FastAPI/Flask, PostgreSQL/MySQL, Redis, Vendor APIs/Web Scraping
   - **Workflow**:
     - **Add to Cart**: When an item is added to the cart, fetch price comparisons from various vendors.
     - **Price Comparison**:
       - Check if price data is cached in Redis.
       - If not, fetch from vendor APIs or scrape websites, update Redis with the latest data, and serve it to the user.
     - **Cart Management**: Display items in the cart along with price comparisons. Allow users to select their preferred vendor.

5. **Price Data Aggregation and Updates**:
   - **Tech Stack**: FastAPI/Flask, Redis, Celery (for periodic tasks), Vendor APIs/Web Scraping
   - **Workflow**:
     - **Fetch Prices**: Regularly update price data using APIs or web scraping.
     - **Cache Prices**: Store the latest prices in Redis with a TTL.
     - **Schedule Updates**: Use Celery to periodically update prices in the background.

6. **Rate Limiting (API Requests to Vendors)**:
   - **Tech Stack**: Redis
   - **Workflow**:
     - Track the number of API requests made to each vendor.
     - Ensure API rate limits are not exceeded by checking and updating counts in Redis.

7. **Image Storage and Serving**:
   - **Tech Stack**: AWS S3/Cloudinary
   - **Workflow**:
     - Store and serve images for fashion items (dresses) from cloud storage services.

8. **Frontend Integration**:
   - **Tech Stack**: React Native/Flutter (for mobile), or a web-based frontend
   - **Workflow**:
     - Communicate with the backend API for user authentication, swiping actions, fetching recommendations, and displaying price comparisons.

### **Tech Stack Summary**

1. **Backend Framework**:
   - **FastAPI** or **Flask** for building the API.

2. **Recommendation Model**:
   - **PyTorch** for training and deploying recommendation models.

3. **Database**:
   - **PostgreSQL** or **MySQL** for storing user interactions, favorites, cart data, and other relational information.

4. **Caching**:
   - **Redis** for caching recommendations, price comparisons, and session management.

5. **Price Data Aggregation**:
   - **Vendor APIs** for fetching price data (e.g., Amazon, Walmart).
   - **Web Scraping** tools (e.g., BeautifulSoup, Scrapy) if APIs are not available.

6. **Background Task Scheduling**:
   - **Celery** for scheduling periodic tasks such as price updates.

7. **Image Storage**:
   - **AWS S3** or **Cloudinary** for storing and serving images of fashion items.

8. **Frontend**:
   - **React Native** or **Flutter** for building mobile apps.
   - Web frontend if applicable.

9. **Optional**:
   - **Redis** for session management if needed for fast access to session data.
   - **Rate Limiting** mechanism in Redis to handle API request limits.

### **Workflow Diagram**
Here’s a simplified workflow diagram for clarity:

```
User Interaction → Backend API (FastAPI/Flask)
    ↓                        ↓
  Swipes                 Recommendations
    ↓                        ↓
  Favorites                 Redis Cache (Recommendations)
    ↓                        ↓
   Cart                    Price Comparison (Vendor APIs/Scraping)
    ↓                        ↓
   Redis Cache (Prices)    Store Prices in Redis
    ↓                        ↓
   Price Comparison       Periodic Price Updates (Celery)
    ↓
  Display in Cart
```

This workflow and tech stack ensure that your app can handle user interactions efficiently, provide personalized recommendations, and offer real-time price comparisons while maintaining high performance and scalability.
